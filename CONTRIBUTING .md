## Submitting Pull Requests üöÄ

If you're ready to submit code to fix an issue or add a new feature:
1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your changes.
3. **Make your changes** with clear and atomic commits.
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly.
5. Push your branch to your forked repo and open a Pull Request (PR) on the original repo.
6. Wait for feedback or approval from maintainers.

## Reporting Issues üìå

If you've found a bug or have a suggestion for a new feature:

1. **Check existing issues** to ensure it hasn‚Äôt been reported yet. [Issues](https://github.com/iamkanhaiyakumar/ai-content-generator/issues/new/choose)
2. **Create a new issue** and provide detailed information:
   - A clear title.
   - Detailed steps to reproduce the bug (if applicable).
   - Any relevant screenshots or logs.
   - Your environment (e.g., operating system, version of the AI Content Generator).
3. Use labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`, etc. to categorize your issue.

## Improving Documentation üìñ

If you notice a typo, missing information, or outdated content in the documentation:
1. **Create an issue** or **submit a pull request** directly with your changes.
2. Ensure any new sections follow the existing documentation style.

# Good Coding Practices üßë‚Äçüíª

1. **Follow the Project's Code Style**

   - Maintain consistency with the existing code style (indentation, spacing, comments).
   - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
   - Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
   - Avoid hardcoding values; instead, use constants or configuration files when possible.

2. **Write Clear and Concise Comments**

   - Use comments to explain why you did something, not just what you did.
   - Avoid unnecessary comments that state the obvious.
   - Document complex logic and functions with brief explanations to help others understand your thought -process.

3. **Keep Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

   - Avoid duplicating code. Reuse functions, methods, and components whenever possible.
   - If you find yourself copying and pasting code, consider creating a new function or component.

4. **Write Tests**

   - Write unit tests for your functions and components.
   - Ensure your tests cover both expected outcomes and edge cases.
   - Run tests locally before making a pull request to make sure your changes don‚Äôt introduce new bugs.

5. **Code Reviews and Feedback**

   - Be open to receiving constructive feedback from other contributors.
   - Conduct code reviews for others and provide meaningful suggestions to improve the code.
   - Always refactor your code based on feedback to meet the project's standards.

# Commit Message Guidelines üìã

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Format**:
  - Capitalize the first letter.
  - Use imperative mood ("Add feature", not "Added feature").
  - Keep the commit message concise (under 72 characters).

Example:
```
Add support for generating multiple content types
Fix issue with AI response timeout
Update documentation for installation instructions
```
